                    <h3>Project outline</h3>
                    <p>In an advance Internet world, it is imperative for businesses today to understand the benefits utilising this borderless, resource abundant technology. Migrating services online has become a mandatory action in terms of broadening the company’s targeting customer, efficiency of the service as well as keeping in the current technology trend to stay in the competitive market.</p>
                    <p> WOW Digital Image therefore came up with the idea of creating an online passport photo development service allowing users to submit their own photo taken from their phone or camera and submit to our website to receive their downloadabe passport photo. The website is also offering a price that is relatively low comparing to photo labs because production cost is low and easy to manage. idphoto.co.nz can benefit both customers and the company production expenses.</p>
                    <p>WOW Digital Image retail shop has closed in 2016 and followed by the launch of idPhoto online to continue serving customers who want their ID photo done.</p>
